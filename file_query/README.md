# FileQuery
Utility to Search and print json similar to a SQL.

## Future
I'm planning to include support file formats in the future.
* YAML: just need to add a library that support YAML parsing
* CSV, TSV: We need to find a way to rethink how we get the values. Possibly a wrapper for the whole csv file pointing into the line with a name to column index mapping
* XML: We can have, but is not a priority
