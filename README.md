# AndroidShellUtils
Multiple Tools that can be used from CLI to help android devs life

## About this project
This project will be implemented in these submodules:
* utils - broad helpers for other modules
* terminal tables - a helper for building content aware tables for monospace text
* local shell - a simple wrapper for local shell to handle communication and forking processes
* droid shell - a wrapper for 'adb shell'
* droid file sync - a tool to sync remote files on android
* droid device - a tool to listen to connected devices, like 'adb devices'

## Inspiration / motivation
